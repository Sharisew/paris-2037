# Paris 2037

Paris 2037 is a simple experiment with CSS animation and parallax. The style was inspired by old world's fair posters and geometric + negative space illustration. 

This project uses a super lightweight stack. No other required dependencies other than jQuery. The node stuff is there for Grunt & [Autoprefixer](http://css-tricks.com/autoprefixer/) love. 

Performance wise, It works fine on desktop, but may be slower on older phones - I only did the simplest of optimizations, pull requests always appreciated :)
