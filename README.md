# Paris 2013

= replace following:
Kaomojis are like emojis but in the form of text strings like: 
this happy guy ＼（＠￣∇￣＠）／ <br>
or 
this dude flipping over a table (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

Kaomoji Cat is a webapp that helps you find the perfect kaomoji to express how you're feeling. 

While there are way more kaomojis than emojis, kaomojis can be more flexible and expressive. I played off that quirky expressiveness with the character of the Kaomoji cat, fish and red string. The cat and his app hopefully comes across as cute, precocious and maybe a little bit creepy.

-------------------------

experiment in interactive poster design

wanted to do everything from scratch in the lightest weight way . so no external libs , just jquery. High in DRY.


more comfortable with the illustrator pen tool than a paint brush

my roots are in vector based illustration

paris 2037 is a web illustration experiment
cinematic rather than interactive
place to play with negative space illustration and css/jquery animation
dipping my toes into making an illustration come to life in a web native way

element of abstract ness to it

theme pf paris. started with a worlds fair and that glamour
name = started as a poster for a world’s fair based the one in paris in 1937
